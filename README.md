# MoSLib-R1

MoSLib-R1 (Monocular-Stereo Library - Release 1) is a Python-based SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) helper library that works with both monocular and stereo camera systems. This project is designed to perform fundamental visual tasks such as camera calibration, image capturing, and depth estimation.
